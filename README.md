# Bank

Simulate a bank account supporting opening/closing, withdrawals, and deposits
of money. The account can be accessed from multiple threads/processes. Clients can make deposits and withdrawals using the internet, mobile phones, etc. Shops
can charge against the account.

It should be possible to close an account; operations against a closed
account must fail.
